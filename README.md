● The program reads in the times (in minutes) for all three events of a triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and then calculates and displays the total time taken to complete the triathlon.

● The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to complete the triathlon. The qualifying time for awards is 100 minutes. Finally this displays the award that each participant will receive based on the following criteria:

Total time - Award
